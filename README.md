This script automates the steps Nick Chamberlain had to take in Week 5 / Section 4 (he asked if there was a "better way") of RebelWay's 'Cinematic Lighting in Houdini' course. This script requires no changes to the 'Asset Reference' node itself, it adds the needed categories and sub-categories and sets the primpath for you.

This script should be placed in your `scripts` directory, inside another directory called `lop`. The Houdini scripts directory is usually in the same location as your houdini.env file. On Windows this is usually `C:\Users\yourname\Documents\houdini20.0\scripts\lop`. On Mac it is usually `/Users/yourname/Library/Preferences/houdini/20.0/scripts`. (replace `20.0` with your Houdini version)
